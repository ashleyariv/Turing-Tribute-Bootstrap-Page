        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Mathison Turing</a> was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.</p>

        <h2>Turing's Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1938 Turing earned a doctorate degree from Princeton University.</li>
            <li>During World War II Turing led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. His daily task was to intercept and decipher German Enigma code. This led to his creation of the <q>a-machine</q> (automatic machine) later named after him, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#:~:text=14%20External%20links-,Overview,sequential%20memory%20to%20store%20data." target="_blank">Turing machine</a>.</li>
            <li>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer.</li>
        </ul>
